# bullgrid

The best grid you will ever use. Standalone, modified version of [Harry Robert's](http://csswizardry.com/) [inuit.css
Grids](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/blob/master/objects/_grids.scss). 

## Usage

### Include the Grid

Import the grid into your Sass (SCSS) Project as you'd do with any other file.

```scss
@import "vendor/bullgrid/_bullgrid.scss";
```

To gain the benefit of using the included [Breakpoint
Mixin](https://github.com/synoa/bullgrid/blob/master/_breakpoint.scss)
everywhere, include it before any other file. The default breakpoint Mixin is
[this
one](https://bitbucket.org/wesruv/breakpoint/src/04efe65bbc8aa70241a610eda58c99b630f337dd/_breakpoint.scss?at=master)
 by Wes Ruvalcaba.

```scss
@import "vendor/bullgrid/_breakpoint.scss";
// include other files here
```

Inside `_breakpoint.scss` you can modify the breakpoints and their names.

You can, however, switch to another breakpoint mixin as you like. To set up the
grid using your own breakpoint mixin include it into the file. Then call the
`grid-setup()` function with your own breakpoint mixin - or leave it out if you
don't want to use breakpoints at all. 

#### `grid-setup`

The `grid-setup` function creates the markup for all grids. You can pass in a
namespace, usually the breakpoint name (e.g. `large`, `huge`, etc.) and it will
render the classes for you. The `grid-setup()` function must be called once
without arguments and without a media query to generate the default markup
(e.g. `.one-half`). Then it can be called using the breakpoint mixin.
```scss
// use the breakpoint mixin to create
// a media query, it's content will be the
// classes generated by grid-setup()
@include breakpoint(large) {
  // use the function and specify 
  // a name for this viewport-based
  // grid setup
  grid-setup('desktop-');
}
// will render this grid markup
@media all and (max-width: 90em) {
  .desktop-one-half {}
  .desktop-one-sixth {} 
}
```

### Using the Grid
Basic Markup
```html
<div class="gw">
  <div class="g one-half">
    I'm one half!
  </div>
  <div class="g one-half">
    I'm another half!
  </div>
</div>
```

You can see an example of the Grid in use [here on
CodePen](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/MYGRKK).

More examples can be found in the [example
section](#examples).

```html
<div class="gw">

  <div class="g one-third small-one-whole">
     <p>Content</p>
  </div>

  <div class="g two-thirds small-one-whole">
    <p>Content</p>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <div class="g one-half">
    <p>One half grid</p>
  </div>

  <div class="g one-quarter">
    <p>One quarter grid</p>
  </div>

  <div class="g one-quarter">
    <p>One quarter grid</p>
  </div>

</div>

```

## Examples

### Nesting Grids.

In this demo we showcase some basic nesting of grids inside grids (`.gw`) and
childs inside childs (`.g`).

### Real-world Example: Product Grid

In this basic demo we showcase a grid of 3x2 elements that represent a product
grid.
